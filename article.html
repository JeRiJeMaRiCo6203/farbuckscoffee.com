        <h1 class="judul">Benefit of Drinking Coffee to Start Your Day</h1>
        <p class="team">FArbucks Team</p>
        <p>Many people like to start the day  with a cup of coffee, and for good reason! There are several benefits to making coffee a part of your daily life. Here are some of our favorites: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coffee boosts your energy</li>
            <p>Everyone knows it. That's why we drink coffee in the first place! Caffeine in  coffee is involved in this, and human studies have shown that coffee actually increases brain function, especially memory, mood, energy levels, and reaction time. Coffee is a great way to get  up  for the day and get ready to get to work. 
            </p>
            <li>Coffee helps you burn fat</li>
            <p>Come again? That`s right– in several studies, caffeine has been shown to boost your metabolic rate, meaning you burn calories faster. More specifically, the studies show that the caffeine can increase the burning of fat. So if you`re not concerned about losing weight right now, while you`re stopping in at FArbucks for a cup of coffee, you can also grab a candy bar on your way out to make up for the deficit. 
            </p>
            <li>Coffee is nutritious</li>
            <p> Coffee Bean nutrients  are found in coffee. Drinking coffee gives you  the essential nutrients  riboflavin, pantothenic acid, manganese, potassium and magnesium. Coffee also contains a large amount of antioxidants that prevent cell damage. Fruits and vegetables are another good source of antioxidants, but if you feel you're running out of fruits and vegetables for the day, be sure to drink a cup of coffee to get the antioxidants in your body. Please raise the level. 
            </p>
            <li>Coffee reduce the risk of illness</li>
            <p>People who drink coffee are less likely to develop type II diabetes, stroke, heart disease, liver cancer, and colon cancer. Wow, please have another drink! 
            </p>
            <li>Coffee can help you live longer</li>
            <p>It makes sense because drinking  coffee has a low risk of getting the most common illness in the United States. However, apart from these reasons, coffee drinkers tend to live longer and have a lower risk of  premature death.</p>
